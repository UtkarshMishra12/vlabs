            Synchro error detector: Synchro transmitter and synchro control transmitter arrangement for
            converting angular position difference into a proportional a.c.
            The winding on the rotor of a synchro transmitter is connected to an a.c. supply voltage
            and this rotor is held fixed at a desired angular position any r The stator winding of synchro
            transmitter and also that the synchro control transformer is wound at 120 in space on the stator.
            The two stator winding are connected together.The location of transmitter and control transformer
            can be away from each other.The rotor of synchro transmitter is salient pole type and that of
            synchro control transformer is cylindrical type.
            The rotor of control transformer is coupled to the output shaft of the control system .If the
            position of the output shaft is indicated as  this results in as angular error e = (r-0) between the
            position of the input reference and the output shafts.
            The process of conversion of the angular difference in to a proportional voltage is
            explained below,
            A single-phase arc voltage
            ei (t) = Em sin (2t)
            Is applied to the rotor winding of the synchro transmitter, then if r = 0 the corresponding voltage
            induce by transformer action across the stator winding e1n is given by
            e1n = KEmsin(2t)
            Where K is proportionality constant
            As the stator winding 2n and 3 n are 240  and 120  a part (angle measured as positive in anticlockwise direction) w.r.t. The winding 1n the voltage induce across them are,
            e2n = K Em sin (2t)cos(240)
            =-0.5 K Em sin(2t)
            e3n= K Em sin (2t)cos(120)
            =-0.5 K Em sin (2t)
            Now if the rotor of the synchro transmitter shifts in anticlockwise direction through an angle r
            the voltage in the stator coil are,
            e1n = K Em sin (2t)cosr
            e2n = K Em sin (2t)cos(240-r)
            e3n = K Em sin (2t)cos(120-r)
            Equation reveal that the magnitudes of the voltage e1n, e2n, and e3nvary sinusoidal w.r.t. r.

            The three-voltage e1n , e2n, and e3n are connected consecutively to three stator winding of the
            control transformer and produce a resultant flux in the air gap of the rotor winding of the control
            transformer. The magnitude of this induce voltage depend on the difference (r-0) If the
            difference (r-0) is zero, the induce voltage across the rotor winding terminal of the control
            transformer is zero, maximum for (r-0) =90 and again zero when (r-0)=180. After 180 the
            phase of the induce voltage reverses.
            The magnitude being again maximum with a reversed phase and finally zero for (r-0) =360.
            The variation of the amplitude of induce voltage across the rotor of control transformer w.r.t. (r-
            0).
            Therefore, the magnitude of the output induces voltage e developed across rotor of control
            transformer is given by the following relation:
            e =Ks sin(r-0)
            Where Ks is a constant of proportionality
            It is to be noted that the frequency of the voltage e is the same as that of supply and the magnitude
            is proportional to the sin(r-0).
            In control system the angular error i.e.(r-0)is usually small and since (r-0) is expressed in
            radian, therefore,
            Sin (r-0) (r-0)
            Hence, e=Ks(r-0)
            And (r-0) is expressed in v/rad.
            The above equation indicates that angular error is converted into a proportional voltage. Laplace
            transform of the above equation is,
            (Es)=Kse(s)
            The block diagram representation of synchro error detector is shown in fig.1, Ks are known as the
            sensitivity or the gain of synchro-error detector.
            The variation of the magnitude of the output voltage e of synchro-error detector is a function of
            time.
            It is to be noted that the phase of e (the output voltage) reverses at the points a and b as the error
            detectore(t) Changes its sign.
